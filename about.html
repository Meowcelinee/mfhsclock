                    this is a custom clock for FHS to track the day&apos;s schedule and highlight what
                    the current &quot;block&quot; is. unfortunately, this site doesn&apos;t display
                    the specific period number, but it at least informs what the current block is, and when the blocks
                    start/end.

                    i made this because the <a href="https://fhsclock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                        rel="noopener">official clock</a> doesn&apos;t seem to work outside of US eastern time.
                    my version of the clock has the block times stored in UTC, and then converts the times based on
                    the client&apos;s timezone, before finally displaying the block schedule with the localized
                    start/end
                    times.
